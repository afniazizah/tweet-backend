Indonesian law emphasizes non-retroactivity except for severe human rights violations. MK

Prabowo reminds me of the protagonist in Midnight in Paris: a man nostalgic for an era he never lived in. His policy priorities choice of words &amp; worldview all hint at a deep yearning for the 1950s a time when the world in his mind was shaped by strongmen &amp; conspiracies.

It's really naive btw if you have voted but told we all to take responsibility and the blame for our country? Never learn from mistakes and realise instead y'all blaming the othe said did not embrace could not move on could not even see the good prabowo shame on you ‍↔️
He even stated for the continuity of the programme from jokowi while the other president's vision-mission made changes so the problem here is that the 02 voters who feel that the prabowo is lesser evil even though he is THE MOST EVIL from his background and political traces

@rstrnpdg but what s happening in raja ampat does not only effect prabowo voters does it?apathy towards 02 voters who suffer from his policies indirectly extends to those who did not vote for 02
You know prabowo's business 'mandeg' when he is not in charge it means despite his powerful grip as oligarch he needs bureaucracy. We can safely assume govt has room to avoid all these policies bcs the fact that the evil couldn't deliver bcs of to what extend the power given.
